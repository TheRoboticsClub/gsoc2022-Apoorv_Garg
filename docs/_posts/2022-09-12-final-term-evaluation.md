I made the decision to consider the project's ongoing work after delivering my final report to the dashboard, Wrapping the Blogs, Videos, and Documentation. Users of Robotics Academy can choose from a wide variety of exercises. Although its application is astounding, it still needs to draw users. We must make the environment more inviting for the users. I looked through various New widget libraries. Making a list of new libraries we can utilise in the future to improve efficiency and user experience while exploring the broad world of open source.


### Future Work

- New Widget Libraries

- Integrate the new communication in react

- Improve the user experience

- Update the documentation with new widgets

-  Make Widgets backward compatible
