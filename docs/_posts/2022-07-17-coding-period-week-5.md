With the First exercise migrated to React based code, we discussed the next steps for the week and decided to proceed with the next exercise that will consists of 3d widgets, so we landed on the 3d-reconstruction exercise. There were one more concern "How exercise developer can use the components easily ?". David Maria Arribas came up with the solution that will help exercise developers to resuse componenets in a convenient way.

### Goals

- [ ] Integrate the React based code with the new solution 

- [ ] Discover new 3d-widgets to build 3d reconstruction exercise 

- [ ] Create a documentation to guide developers
