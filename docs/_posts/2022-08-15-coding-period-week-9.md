Robotics academy has 5 categories of exercises, namely, Autonomous Driving, Service Robots, Drones, Computer Vision and Industrial Robots. With the completion of follow line, 3d reconstruction and vacuum cleaner exercise, 
we were done with autonomous driving, computer vision and service robots respectively. So, we decided to go ahead with one of the remaining category i.e. **Drone**. For the purpose of drone exercise, I was adviced to have talk with [pariaspe](https://github.com/pariaspe) and get the details of the drone exercise. After having a discussion with pariaspe, I took the rescue people and power tower inspection exercise as the next challenge
