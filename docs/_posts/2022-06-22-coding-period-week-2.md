In the weekly meet, we decided to start the project with the migration of follow line exercise. Follow line exercise consists of the most basic components.


### Goals

- [ ] Migrate the follow line exercise


### Accomplishment and Challenges 


* #### Follow Line exercise Migration \[Task 1\]

To migrate the follow line exercise, I first started building the exercise_base.html which had the navigation bar functionality and extended in every exercise. 
In this I built the responsive navigation bar using flex.
