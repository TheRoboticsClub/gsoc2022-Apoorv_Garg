With the Exercise details list sheet, It was easy to plan ahead on how to migrate the remaining exercises into React.

### Goals

- [x] 3D reconstruction Three JS Widget

- [x] Vacuum cleaner Exercise

### Accomplishment and Challenges 

* #### 3D reconstruction Three JS Widget \[Task 1\]
Three, OrbitControls, OBJLoader, Colladloader, 3d_scene, 3dviz, pose3d - Started with the Three JS Widget and completed the exercise specific Script files.

* #### Vacuum cleaner Exercise \[Task 2\]
With the help of the Exercise details list sheet, Follow line exercise matched with vacuum cleaner exercise. So I started working on the vacuum cleaner exercise.
