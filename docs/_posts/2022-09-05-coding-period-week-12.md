Final Week to complete the tasks that are left, For this week we decided to wrap up things and raise the Pull request for the so far migrated exercises with complete documentation.
Final week doesn't mean the project ends here, Final week just represents the last week for gsoc coding period. We discussed about further updates in the project

### Goals

- [x] Create a Widgets documentation

- [x] Create youtube video for the migrated exercise

- [x] Create different exercise card for the react exercise 


### Accomplishment and Challenges

* #### Create a Widgets documentation \[Task 1\]

I created widget documentation to make the widgets more accessible and understandable to developers. The documentation describes the widgets, how to use them, how to create them, how to include them in the exercise, and how to test them.

* #### Create youtube video for the migrated exercise \[Task 2\]

youtube videos provides an interactive way to showcase the exercise and helps attract the users. A User can more effectively learn and grasps the concept. User have easier access to the content anytime. Creating a video not only beneficial to the users or organization but also benefits me as an individual by helping me analyze my presentation skills.

* #### Create different exercise card for the react exercise \[Task 3\]

Vanilla Javascript and react exercises are featured on the homepage. To differentiate between the two, I created a separate exercise card for the react exercise. This will assist the user in determining which exercises are in react and which are in vanilla javascript.
