### Goals

- [x] Create a Widgets documentation

- [x] Create youtube video for the migrated exercise

- [x] Create different exercise card for the react exercise 


### Accomplishment and Challenges

* #### Create a Widgets documentation \[Task 1\]

I created widget documentation to make the widgets more accessible and understandable to developers. The documentation describes the widgets, how to use them, how to create them, how to include them in the exercise, and how to test them. The documentation is available [here](link).

* #### Create youtube video for the migrated exercise \[Task 2\]



* #### Create different exercise card for the react exercise \[Task 3\]

Vanilla Javascript and react exercises are featured on the homepage. To differentiate between the two, I created a separate exercise card for the react exercise. This will assist the user in determining which exercises are in react and which are in vanilla javascript.
