Hello!

I am Apoorv Garg, final year student in Netaji Subhas University of technology, New Delhi, India. This project showcases my contribution for GSoC 2022. The GSoC Project aims to improve and migrate existing web templates by utilising advanced front end technology (REACT). The journey from the initial idea to the final product is illustrated in the [progress report]({{site.url}}/gsoc2022-Apoorv_Garg/progress/). It has been a great experience to work on this project and I hope to continue to contribute to the development of the web templates.
