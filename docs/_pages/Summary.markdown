### The Night I Became a GSoCer ðŸ¥³ ðŸŽŠ
I recall the evening I learned I had been chosen for the GSoC. While I awaited the outcome, I spoke with a close friend who was experiencing the same situation. The announcement of the results was scheduled for May 19, 2022, at 11:30 IST. The time when I continued checking my inbox was 11:31 p.m. I believed I wasn't selected like last year. On the other side, my friend was chosen, so I had to maintain my smile in order to congratulate him. That night I had trouble falling asleep. Two hours later, I received a mail informing me that I had been chosen for Jderobot.



### Community Bonding Period ðŸ—“

During this time, I began learning the rules and collected information about how the organization operates. We talked and decided on a plan for the project. Discussed their expectations for my contribution to the project. We talked about the current implementation and refractor process method.
